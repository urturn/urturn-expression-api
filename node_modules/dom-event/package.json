  "readme": "# dom-event\n\nlow level helper for creating DOM event objects. It abstracts away the goofiness of the DOM api and browser quirks.\n\n## API\n\n```javascript\nvar event = require('dom-event')\n```\n  - [event()](#event)\n\n### event()\n\n  Create a native DOM event\n  \n```js\nevent('mousemove')\nevent('keydown', { key: 'a' })\nevent('user-login')\n```\n\n## Available events\n\n- load\n- unload\n- abort\n- error\n- select\n- change\n- submit\n- reset\n- focus\n- blur\n- resize\n- scroll\n- input\n- click\n- dblclick\n- mousedown\n- mouseup\n- mouseover\n- mousemove\n- mouseout\n- contextmenu\n- keypress\n- keydown\n- keyup\n\nAnything else is currently considered a custom event so doesn't get any special attributes or behaviour.\n\n## Contributing\nThere are many more \"native\" events which should be included. They haven't been added simply because I don't need them just yet. If you add something, e.g. mutation events, please submit a pull-request.\n\n## Release History\n_(Nothing yet)_\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2013 Jakeb Rosoman\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation\nfiles (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without\nrestriction, including without limitation the rights to use,\ncopy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the\nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following\nconditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES\nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\nNONINFRINGEMENT.
